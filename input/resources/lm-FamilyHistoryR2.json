        "comment": "PREFACE:\nThe Family history summary item in Release 1 comprised only a single data element for a narrative description of significant clinical history of family members. The narrative description is useful to provide a narrative sense of the family history of an individual and can also be used to store narrative data about family history from existing clinical systems that are non-conformant with this structure or previously captured only as free text. \n\n<Insert Family history item R1.png here>\n \nIn Release 2, additional data elements have been added to allow information about familial health conditions to be recorded on a ‘Per family member’ basis. Clearly this kind of data needs to be recorded with privacy and confidentiality in mind, so each family member can be identified by an alias if necessary. This model is intended to describe data elements and their attributes that will support a useful digital family history record and potential development of a pedigree chart, where this might be useful in the health record.   \n\n<Insert Family history item R2 AB.png here>\n \nThe addition of the ‘Per family member’ group (A) allows recording of a repeating group of data elements, one instance per family member. The ‘Clinical history’ group (B) allows recording of a repeating group of data elements, one instance per problem/diagnosis. This modelling pattern ensures that the Family history item can contain a simple narrative summary/overview about the family history, plus optional details about an unlimited number of family members and their health problems. \n\nThe scope of the enhancement for Release 2 has been was based on a consensus decision by the Program’s Clinical Working Group. A candidate model for a comprehensive Family history record was presented to the CWG and a pragmatic subset was selected for inclusion in Release 2. The CWG decision criteria for inclusion focused on identifying data elements that would result in improved, consistent primary care records. The candidate model also demonstrated how detail in the Family history summary item might be further enhanced in future releases of the Data Dictionary, providing a strategy for compatible extensions in Release 3 or beyond.",
