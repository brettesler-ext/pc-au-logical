        "comment": "PREFACE:\nThe specific scope of this item is on documentation about all types of inhaled tobacco smoke because of the associated health risks from direct inhalation of tobacco and associated chemicals. Other types of tobacco use, such as smokeless forms of tobacco should be modelled separately.\n\nThe 'Tobacco smoking summary item R1' comprised three optionable data elements – an overall status, an overall narrative description and a date last updated. The narrative description is useful to provide a narrative sense of the smoking habit and history for an individual and can also be used to store narrative data about tobacco smoking from existing clinical systems that are non-conformant with this structure or previously captured only as free text. The value set for tobacco smoking status is lifetime non-smoker, current smoker and former smoker.\n\n<insert Tobacco smoking summary R1.png here>\n   \nIn release 2, additional data elements have been added to allow some structured information about the tobacco smoking to be recorded which support health risk assessments related to tobacco smoking and development of quit smoking strategies for each individual. \n \nThe pattern for recording tobacco smoking first identifies the type of tobacco smoked. It is possible for different types or forms of tobacco to be smoked, each with a different method of recording and potentially a different health risk. In future there may be a need to record episodes of smoking behaviour within each type of tobacco use, for example smoking while pregnant. This differs from the alcohol consumption pattern which is simpler because of the emphasis on the number of standard drinks rather than details about the type, strength and volume of alcohol.\n\nClinicians wanted to know when regular smoking of any type of tobacco commenced, as an indication of the length of smoking habit. It was also noted that in most Australian clinical systems it was incorrectly assumed that only cigarettes were smoked. This DDR2 model allows for any type of tobacco smoking to be recorded, including details about the use for each type. The ‘Per type’ heading is a repeating group of data elements related to each type of tobacco smoked - for example cigarettes (commercial or ‘roll your owns’), cigars, pipes, hookah etc, as required. The overall ‘Quit date’ for all types of tobacco has also been added, plus a calculation of ‘Overall pack years’ which can be calculated based on cigarettes, but also other types of tobacco.\n\n<insert Tobacco smoking summary R2.png here>\n  \nThe limitation of this model is that it implies that individuals don’t change how they smoke over time and that it is reasonable to record a ‘typical use’. Obviously actual use may vary enormously in reality. In future this model can be extended to capture varying patterns of tobacco smoking over time – for example, cutting down during a pregnancy but returning to previous levels after the birth. In addition, a complementary model could be added to support recording actual use, such as might be required for a smoking diary. \n\nThe scope of the enhancement for Release 2 has been is based on a consensus decision by the Program’s Clinical Working Group. A candidate model for a comprehensive Tobacco smoking summary record was presented to the CWG and a pragmatic subset was selected for inclusion in Release 2. The CWG decision criteria for inclusion focussed on identifying data elements that would result in improved, consistent primary care records. The candidate model demonstrated how the Tobacco smoking item might be further enhanced in the future releases of the Data Dictionary, enabling a strategy for potential backwardly compatible extensions in Release 3 or beyond.",
