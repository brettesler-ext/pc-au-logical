Most commonly this summary is likely to be related to a specific health event such as a specific consultation or hospital admission, but may also be used to summarise the patient's health experience over varying time periods.\n\nIn practice, a clinical synopsis is used to capture a summary that will complement the existing structured clinical record, by allowing clinicians to express subtle nuances, subjective information or interpretations about the patient's situation, clinical events or activities that might not be obvious through structured data alone. For example, a clinical synopsis can communicate a concise summary of the patient's hospital admission as one component of a comprehensive and structured Discharge Summary document."

Identification of the type of reaction is not a proxy for seriousness or risk of harm to the patient, which is better expressed by the manifestation in clinical practice.\n\nThe risk of an adverse reaction event or manifestation should not be recorded without identifying a proposed causative substance or class of substance. If there is uncertainty that a specific substance is the cause, this uncertainty can be recorded using the ‘Verification status’ data element. If there are multiple possible substances that may have caused a reaction/manifestation, each substance should be recorded using a separate instance of this adverse reaction archetype with the ‘Status’ set to an initial state of ‘Unconfirmed’ so that adverse reaction checking can be activated in clinical systems. Once the substance, agent or class is later proven not to be the cause for a given reaction then the ‘Status’ can be modified to ‘Refuted’.\n\nThis item has been designed to allow recording of information about a specific substance (amoxycillin, oysters, or bee sting venom) or, alternatively, a class of substance (eg Penicillins). If a class of substance is recorded then identification of the exact substance can be recorded on a per exposure basis."

This information may be used to contribute to the identification of a current health problem, assessment of future risk from familial problems or conditions, or to initiate preventive health activities.\n\nTraditionally the scope of family history has been focused on genetic factors or biomarkers as indicators of risk or potential risk. The scope of this item includes both recording of problems or diagnoses that have an inheritable origin as well as those that are not directly inheritable but influenced by the domestic setting, including psychosocial or environmental factors. Examples include exposure to toxins in the family environment, domestic violence, sexual abuse, alcoholism and other addictions.\n\nNon-genetic family members can include adopted or long term fostered children, those related by marriage, or other unrelated individuals who participate in the regular life and influence of the family.\n\nIt may be necessary to identify each family member specifically and not just by the relationship to the individual. For example, while there will be only one maternal grandmother, there may be many female maternal cousins. This may be required to ensure that a pedigree chart is accurate. It will also enable accurate amendments to the record for each identified family member. If the record is private and will not be shared, for reasons of clarity it may be preferable to record the relative's actual name. If the record, or part of the record, is to be shared, it may be more appropriate for the family member to be identified by a unique label or alias.\n\nRecord as a single instance in a health record, updated and revised over time as a new version."

                "comment": "PREFACE:\nThe Family history summary item in Release 1 comprised only a single data element for a narrative description of significant clinical history of family members. The narrative description is useful to provide a narrative sense of the family history of an individual and can also be used to store narrative data about family history from existing clinical systems that are non-conformant with this structure or previously captured only as free text. \n\n<Insert Family history item R1.png here>\n \nIn Release 2, additional data elements have been added to allow information about familial health conditions to be recorded on a ‘Per family member’ basis. Clearly this kind of data needs to be recorded with privacy and confidentiality in mind, so each family member can be identified by an alias if necessary. This model is intended to describe data elements and their attributes that will support a useful digital family history record and potential development of a pedigree chart, where this might be useful in the health record.   \n\n<Insert Family history item R2 AB.png here>\n \nThe addition of the ‘Per family member’ group (A) allows recording of a repeating group of data elements, one instance per family member. The ‘Clinical history’ group (B) allows recording of a repeating group of data elements, one instance per problem/diagnosis. This modelling pattern ensures that the Family history item can contain a simple narrative summary/overview about the family history, plus optional details about an unlimited number of family members and their health problems. \n\nThe scope of the enhancement for Release 2 has been was based on a consensus decision by the Program’s Clinical Working Group. A candidate model for a comprehensive Family history record was presented to the CWG and a pragmatic subset was selected for inclusion in Release 2. The CWG decision criteria for inclusion focused on identifying data elements that would result in improved, consistent primary care records. The candidate model also demonstrated how detail in the Family history summary item might be further enhanced in future releases of the Data Dictionary, providing a strategy for compatible extensions in Release 3 or beyond.",

This information may be used to contribute to the identification of a current health problem, assessment of future risk from familial problems or conditions, or to initiate preventive health activities.\n\nTraditionally the scope of family history has been focused on genetic factors or biomarkers as indicators of risk or potential risk. The scope of this item includes both recording of problems or diagnoses that have an inheritable origin as well as those that are not directly inheritable but influenced by the domestic setting, including psycho-social or environmental factors. Examples include exposure to toxins in the family environment, domestic violence, sexual abuse, alcoholism and other addictions.\n\nNon-genetic family members can include adopted or long term fostered children, those related by marriage, or other unrelated individuals who participate in the regular life and influence of the family.\n\nIt may be necessary to identify each family member specifically and not just by the relationship to the individual. For example, while there will be only one maternal grandmother, there may be many female maternal cousins. This may be required to ensure that a pedigree chart is accurate. It will also enable accurate amendments to the record for each identified family member. If the record is private and will not be shared, for reasons of clarity it may be preferable to record the relative's actual name. If the record, or part of the record, is to be shared, it may be more appropriate for the family member to be identified by a unique label or alias.\n\nRecord as a single instance in a health record; updated and revised over time as a new version."

                "comment": "PREFACE:\nThe specific scope of this item is on documentation about all types of inhaled tobacco smoke because of the associated health risks from direct inhalation of tobacco and associated chemicals. Other types of tobacco use, such as smokeless forms of tobacco should be modelled separately.\n\nThe 'Tobacco smoking summary item R1' comprised three optionable data elements – an overall status, an overall narrative description and a date last updated. The narrative description is useful to provide a narrative sense of the smoking habit and history for an individual and can also be used to store narrative data about tobacco smoking from existing clinical systems that are non-conformant with this structure or previously captured only as free text. The value set for tobacco smoking status is lifetime non-smoker, current smoker and former smoker.\n\n<insert Tobacco smoking summary R1.png here>\n   \nIn release 2, additional data elements have been added to allow some structured information about the tobacco smoking to be recorded which support health risk assessments related to tobacco smoking and development of quit smoking strategies for each individual. \n \nThe pattern for recording tobacco smoking first identifies the type of tobacco smoked. It is possible for different types or forms of tobacco to be smoked, each with a different method of recording and potentially a different health risk. In future there may be a need to record episodes of smoking behaviour within each type of tobacco use, for example smoking while pregnant. This differs from the alcohol consumption pattern which is simpler because of the emphasis on the number of standard drinks rather than details about the type, strength and volume of alcohol.\n\nClinicians wanted to know when regular smoking of any type of tobacco commenced, as an indication of the length of smoking habit. It was also noted that in most Australian clinical systems it was incorrectly assumed that only cigarettes were smoked. This DDR2 model allows for any type of tobacco smoking to be recorded, including details about the use for each type. The ‘Per type’ heading is a repeating group of data elements related to each type of tobacco smoked - for example cigarettes (commercial or ‘roll your owns’), cigars, pipes, hookah etc, as required. The overall ‘Quit date’ for all types of tobacco has also been added, plus a calculation of ‘Overall pack years’ which can be calculated based on cigarettes, but also other types of tobacco.\n\n<insert Tobacco smoking summary R2.png here>\n  \nThe limitation of this model is that it implies that individuals don’t change how they smoke over time and that it is reasonable to record a ‘typical use’. Obviously actual use may vary enormously in reality. In future this model can be extended to capture varying patterns of tobacco smoking over time – for example, cutting down during a pregnancy but returning to previous levels after the birth. In addition, a complementary model could be added to support recording actual use, such as might be required for a smoking diary. \n\nThe scope of the enhancement for Release 2 has been is based on a consensus decision by the Program’s Clinical Working Group. A candidate model for a comprehensive Tobacco smoking summary record was presented to the CWG and a pragmatic subset was selected for inclusion in Release 2. The CWG decision criteria for inclusion focussed on identifying data elements that would result in improved, consistent primary care records. The candidate model demonstrated how the Tobacco smoking item might be further enhanced in the future releases of the Data Dictionary, enabling a strategy for potential backwardly compatible extensions in Release 3 or beyond.",

                "comment": "PREFACE: \nThe Alcohol consumption item in Release 1 comprised three optionable data elements – an overall status, an overall narrative description and a date last updated. The narrative description is useful to provide a narrative sense of the alcohol consumption habit and history for an individual and can also be used to store narrative data about alcohol consumption from existing clinical systems that are non-conformant with this structure or previously captured only as free text. The value set for alcohol consumption status is lifetime non-drinker, current drinker and former drinker.  \n\n<Insert Alcohol consumption summary R1.png here>\n\nIn Release 2, additional data elements have been added to allow some structured information about the alcohol consumption to be recorded which support health risk assessments related to alcohol consumption and development of alcohol reduction strategies for each individual.  \n\nThe pattern for recording alcohol consumptions first identifies episodes. It may be that only one typical episode is ever recorded, although it is possible to represent episodes of sobriety or reduced drinking during pregnancy etc. The emphasis in this model is on the number of standard drinks rather than details about the type, strength and volume of alcohol.\n\n<Insert Alcohol consumption summary R2.png here>\n \nThe scope of the enhancement for DDR2 has been is based on a consensus decision by the Program’s Clinical Working Group. A candidate model for a comprehensive Alcohol consumption summary was presented to the CWG and a pragmatic subset was selected for inclusion in Release 2. The CWG decision criteria for inclusion focussed on identifying data elements that would result in improved, consistent primary care records. The candidate model demonstrated how the alcohol consumption item might be further enhanced in the future releases of the Data Dictionary, enabling a strategy for potential backwardly compatible extensions in Release 3 or beyond.",
